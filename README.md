#PinDialog
Dialog for entering vary-length digital pin code. Android, API 8 compatible.

##Attention Message
There is no any pin-protection mechanism. If you need it look at https://github.com/OrangeGangsters/LolliPin.

##Usage
```
...
        //callback to specify action to do with pin-code entered by user
        OnPinEnteredListener onPinCodeEnteredListener = new OnPinEnteredListener() {
            @Override
            public void onPinEntered(String pin) {showShortToastWithText(pin);}
        };

        //instantiating and showing full-screen dialog with pin-pad
        Dialog d = new DecimalPinDialog(this, 3, onPinCodeEnteredListener);
        d.show();
    }

    private void showShortToastWithText(String text) {
        Toast.makeText(this, text, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
```
